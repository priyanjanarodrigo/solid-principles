==================
> SOLID Principles
==================

* SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in Object-Oriented software development/ programming.
  It's a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles

    1. Single Responsibility Principle
    2. Open-Closed Principle
    3. Liskov Substitution Principle
    4. Interface Segregation Principle
    5. Dependency Inversion Principle

* Code becomes more testable (remember TTD(Test Driven Development) is not only about testing, more
  important it's about design)

* Don't do stuff 'just because of' - very important to see the context of the program/code when applying SOLID
