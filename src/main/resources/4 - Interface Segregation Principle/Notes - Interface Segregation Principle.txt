Interface Segregation
----------------------

* "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use" (Robert Martin)

    - Keep interfaces small
    - Don't force classes to implement the methods they can't/not required at all
    - Do not pollute interfaces a lot of methods
    - Avoid fat interfaces
